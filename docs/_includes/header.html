            <h1>Why Yellow Taxi, Not Subway</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Sometimes people could take subway from A to B (directly, no transfer), but they take a yellow cab instead. We are wondering which subway line is the one that people are most unwilling to take, by detecting peopleâ€™s choice pattern based on location, time and day of the week, we would like to answer the question why people would choose yellow cab instead of subway.</p>
